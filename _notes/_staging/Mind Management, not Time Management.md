>“Things are not difficult to make; what is difficult is putting ourselves in the state of mind to make them. —Constantin Brancusi” (Kadavy, 2020, p. 9)

>“Until one day you realize: “There’s only twenty-four hours in a day.” Maybe that doesn’t mean what I thought it meant? I thought it meant I should get the most done in the least amount of time possible. What I’m learning is, if there’s only twenty-four hours in a day, that means there’s a limit. I can only get so much out of my time. “Time management” is like squeezing blood from a stone.” (Kadavy, 2020, p. 10)

>“Your edge as a human is not in doing something quickly. No matter how fast you move, a computer can move faster. Your edge as a human is in thinking the thoughts behind the doing. As entrepreneur and investor Naval Ravikant has said, “Earn with your mind, not your time.”” (Kadavy, 2020, p. 15)

>“Time has become our “God value.” Author Mark Manson describes a God value as the “top of our value hierarchy,” and “the lens through which we interpret all other values.”” (Kadavy, 2020, p. 19)

>“We have the gall to refer to unused time as “free” time” (Kadavy, 2020, p. 21)

>“Time is apparently money when your boss is using it, yet somehow it’s “free” time when it’s leftover for you to use.” (Kadavy, 2020, p. 21)

>“The first false assumption time management makes is that time management treats time as a commodity. “Everyone has the same twenty-four hours in the day,” you’ll hear people say. It’s as if you could line up those hours like bushels of corn, or blocks of frozen orange juice concentrate – each unit the same as the previous unit. But that’s far from true.” (Kadavy, 2020, p. 22)

>“Just ask opera singer Marian Anderson, who said – when learning a new piece of music – “What has appeared useless labor for days becomes fruitful at an unpredictable moment.”” (Kadavy, 2020, p. 23)

>“Additionally, some experts have already built the foundation for mind management. My personal favorite productivity system, David Allen’s Getting Things Done, helps free up your creative energy by putting all the inputs in your life into a “trusted system.” It’s what Maura Thomas would call Attention Management. More recently, Cal Newport identified that in an age with unprecedented sources of distraction, it’s those who can cultivate Deep Work who will get an edge.” (Kadavy, 2020, p. 24)

>“Consider this passage from Getting Things Done. It’s what Allen calls “The Four-Criteria Model for Choosing Actions in the Moment,” which is a method for deciding what task you can do at any given moment: “At 3:22 on Wednesday, how do you choose what to do? At that moment there are four criteria you can apply, in this order: context, time available, energy available, and priority.” (Kadavy, 2020, p. 25)

>“Elite athletes warm up before a big game. They wouldn’t expect to roll out of bed and perform at their peak. Yet too many of us treat our to-do lists as if anything is possible at any moment. What if, at 3:22 every Wednesday, you didn’t have to decide what to do? What if you managed your creative energy so well that, instead of staring, puzzled, at your to-do list, it was obvious what you should do at that time. This level of mastery is possible with mind management.” (Kadavy, 2020, p. 25)

>“The next time you set out to be productive, ask yourself, What work am I in the mood to do right now? Then, ask yourself, What do I need to do that fits that mood?” (Kadavy, 2020, p. 25)

>“But sometimes, something simply needs to get done now. In these cases, you can ask yourself, What mood would be most conducive to doing this work? Then, ask yourself, When was the last time I felt that way?” (Kadavy, 2020, p. 25)

>“To begin, I’ll optimize for the type of thinking I need my brain to do. Creative work such as writing requires both “divergent” and “convergent” thinking.” (Kadavy, 2020, p. 33)

>“The main drawback of doing work while your prefrontal cortex is still sleeping is that when your prefrontal cortex is sleeping, you’re missing out on all the good stuff your prefrontal cortex does for you. As I get settled in my new life, I notice that my morning writing sessions are going – just okay. I’m having great ideas, when I can get myself to write. But I easily get distracted.” (Kadavy, 2020, p. 44)

>“If you make an appointment with a Colombian a week from today, they will say that it’s *en ocho dias* – in eight days. The first time I heard this, I was incredibly confused. Today is Wednesday, so – eight days – you mean next Thursday? To a clock-time person, the appointment is in seven days. Seven rotations of the earth separate right now from the time of the appointment, a week from now. But from an event-time perspective, it’s not seven days – it’s eight: Today is an event, which has not yet ended.” (Kadavy, 2020, p. 50)

>“Avnet and Sellier’s study also demonstrated that clock-time and event-time approaches aren’t strictly cultural. Most of us change our approach based upon what we’re trying to accomplish.” (Kadavy, 2020, p. 51)

>“You can imagine how a clock-time orientation would be more compatible with analytical thinking. Like a jogging path, there are steps to follow, so you can estimate how long each of those steps will take. By contrast, you can see how an event-time orientation would be more compatible with insightful thinking. You have to go down many dead ends to solve the maze. When you finally do reach a solution, it will be sudden. But when will that happen? It’s hard to predict.” (Kadavy, 2020, p. 53)

>“Don’t judge each day by the harvest you reap, but by the seeds you plant. —Robert Louis Stevenson” (Kadavy, 2020, p. 59)

>“Social psychologist Graham Wallas also related to Helmholtz’s speech. Thirty five years after the fact, he formalized Helmholtz’s observations on the creative process into what he called four “stages of control.” These four stages make the random and mysterious creative process seem a little less random and mysterious.” (Kadavy, 2020, p. 62)

>“So, the four stages of control – which scientists widely refer to as the Four Stages of Creativity – are Preparation, Incubation, Illumination, and Verification.” (Kadavy, 2020, p. 62)

Preparation is sort of like scoping a problem, finding all the twists and turns, and steps. Incubation is time spent recovering from preparing (setting aside, gaining energy). Then comes illumination, when inspiration strikes. Finally, verify/edit/polish.

>“Prioritize, Explore, Research, Generate, Polish, Administrate, and Recharge.” (Kadavy, 2020, p. 79) 

Not sure I buy these as a good categorization of types of work. They seem useful but blurry. Based on tyes of tasks: Prioritize is more like assessing/mapping. Explore is wandering. Generation is creating something. Polish and Administrate are the same process but split between creative/noncreative. And Recharge is just something else.

>“But you can do even more to make the most of your mental energy. You can go beyond adjusting your environment and your tools. Yes, your work progresses through the Four Stages of Creativity more smoothly when you work according to mental state. But when you master how mental states cycle throughout time, you truly have a well-oiled creative machine.” (Kadavy, 2020, p. 93)

>“You can build more effective Creative Cycles if you pay attention to the rhythms around you. You’ll find these rhythms in the natural world, such as sunrises and sunsets, and the change of seasons. You’ll also find these rhythms in cultural cues, such as our designations of days, weeks, and months – and in our rituals around eating, sleeping, or celebrating holidays. Finally, you’ll find these rhythms in your own energy fluctuations. There will be times when your energy lends itself to being creative, and other times when your energy lends itself to being analytical.” (Kadavy, 2020, p. 95)

>“When you’re working on your toughest creative problems, that’s when you need Incubation the most. There are so many loose ends to consider, you’ll create a logjam if you try to power through the problem all at once. The Minimum Creative Dose helps you activate those loose ends. It helps you create open loops.” (Kadavy, 2020, p. 126) 

This is really interesting-- while closed loops protect our attention, our creative work desires open loops (incubation). Hmmm....

>“Yes, I had my tasks broken down by the Minimum Creative Dose. They were spaced out so my Passive Genius could take care of much of the work.” (Kadavy, 2020, p. 148)

>“As Ray Bradbury said, “We are cups, constantly and quietly being filled. The trick is, knowing how to tip ourselves over and let the beautiful stuff out.”” (Kadavy, 2020, p. 153)

>“There are two big things that make inboxes powerful: One, inboxes let you close the conscious open loop about an idea. You aren’t able to address the idea in the moment, so it goes in an inbox. Two, inboxes give you something to work with when you finally are available to process ideas.” (Kadavy, 2020, p. 154)

>“When I review my main inbox, I don’t necessarily “do” the item. Usually, I simply push it further down the cascade. For example, I might write in my pocket notebook an idea for improving the Sloppy Operating Procedure for my podcast. When I review my notebook, in the Prioritize mental state, I transfer that idea to my Sloppy Operating Procedure document. Since my SOP document is sloppy, it’s essentially an inbox – it can capture undeveloped ideas.” (Kadavy, 2020, p. 155)

>“This way, I can always quickly close the conscious loop of an idea. I can get that idea into a place where I can further engage with it later – when I’ll give myself the Minimum Creative Dose, and open some subconscious loops.” (Kadavy, 2020, p. 156)
