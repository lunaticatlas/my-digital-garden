Condition: A pretty practical self-help book that served as fodder for thinking about time better. Some worthwhile tidbits and strong insights.

# 🌱📖💧

>“What surprised me most about people’s answers was the disconnect between how important many of these time and money decisions were and how trivial they seemed in the moment. These trade-offs are so seemingly dull or obvious, we often don’t even realize we’re making them.” (Whillans, 2020, p. 2)

>“These stories show that these decisions sneak up on us, and that any given choice, whether it’s a big decision like what career to choose or a tiny decision like whether to use those last two vacation days—seems to be inconsequential and easy to reverse. But it is not. All these decisions powerfully shape the happiness we derive from moments, from days, from our entire lives.” (Whillans, 2020, p. 2)

>“Nicole sighed and said, “I can’t. I have an important meeting that I shouldn’t miss.” Thomas hit the slopes with his sister Leah instead, and the siblings enjoyed what they both deemed “the best trip ever.” “Five years later, they still talk about this damn trip,” Nicole told me. “And, whenever they do, Thomas asks me, ‘Nicole, what was that meeting about again?’ ‘To be honest, I can’t remember.’ He always replies, ‘That important, huh?’”” (Whillans, 2020, p. 3)

>“Alice told herself what many of us tell ourselves when we sacrifice our time for jobs and money: “It’s fine. I’m doing this now so I will have more time to be happy tomorrow, and I can make it up to people then.”” (Whillans, 2020, p. 4)

>“This is one of the core discoveries I’ve made researching time and money: we don’t understand well that time is our most valuable resource, and it is finite. Chasing money is valuable to a point, but it’s an infinite errand.” (Whillans, 2020, p. 5)

>“This sounds heavy, and it is. My research has shown me that the stakes really are this high. People tend to focus too much on working and making money and not enough on having more and better time. Most of us, myself included, fail to value time as much as money. This focus on money contributes to the epidemic levels of stress, unhappiness, and loneliness that many societies struggle with. It costs us a lot, financially and otherwise. Collectively researchers call this phenomenon time poverty, and it is chronic.” (Whillans, 2020, p. 6)

>“Nothing less than our health and our happiness depends on reversing the nearly innate notion that time is money. It’s not. Money is time. This book will help you live that truth.” (Whillans, 2020, p. 7) 

I thought this turn of phrase would come up.

>“Taylor would rather work fewer hours and make less money than work more hours and make more money.” (Whillans, 2020, p. 8) 

This is my archetype and the choice I made in Chile: but the trade as a lawyer is different: I will choose to work more hours and make less money!

>“I have presented this activity to tens of thousands of people. Just by knowing whether someone’s a Taylor or a Morgan, I can predict behavior with surprising accuracy. I know what kinds of flights they’ll choose and what kinds of gifts they value most. I can also predict how many hours they work, if they volunteer, their socializing behaviors, and even what kinds of jobs they’ll take. It’s not a magic trick; it’s only matching data to behaviors.” (Whillans, 2020, p. 9)

>“Most important of all, being time-centric is prosocial, which is the word academics use to describe actions that benefit others.” (Whillans, 2020, p. 10)

>“The secret to happier time is simple: prioritize time over money—one decision at a time.” (Whillans, 2020, p. 12)

>“Long blocks of free time we used to enjoy are now interrupted constantly by our smart watches, phones, tablets, and laptops. This situation taxes us cognitively, and fragments our leisure time in a way that makes it hard to use this time for something that will relieve stress or make us happy.20 I (and other researchers) call this phenomenon time confetti, which amounts to little bits of seconds and minutes lost to unproductive multitasking.21 Each bit alone seems not very bad. Collectively, though, all that confetti adds up to something more pernicious than you might expect.” (Whillans, 2020, p. 16) 

Ok, distraction fragments our time into pieces which ruin our blocks of time, time confetti is a pretty good name for this.

>“In data from 1.7 million people in 165 countries, researchers figured out the exact dollar amount at which added money no longer increases happiness. After we make USD$65,000 per year ($60,000 globally), money stops predicting how much we laugh or smile each day. After we make USD$105,000 per year ($95,000 globally), money stops predicting how well we think we are doing in life. If anything, once people make a lot of money ($105,000 per year in the United States), they start thinking they are doing worse in life. When we become rich, we begin to compare our lives to people even richer than we are” (Whillans, 2020, p. 20) 

Money predicts how much we laugh and smile each day, if we make under 60k. After 100k, money stops predicting our self-eval of how well we are doing in life (that's the start of the hedonic treadmill).

>“Focusing on chasing wealth is a trap. It leads only to an increased focus on chasing wealth.” (Whillans, 2020, p. 21)

>“For most of us, the idea of trading cash for time doesn’t even cross our minds. This is largely because it’s hard to measure time’s value” (Whillans, 2020, p. 21) 

Fuck, she's talking directly to me! I love less money but more time intensive solutions (doing my own laundry, etc).

>“With our self-identity so wrapped up in work and productivity, the social appearance of being busy makes us feel good about ourselves.” (Whillans, 2020, p. 25) 

Earlier she also mentioned the social pressure to be seen as 'busy' because unbusy people are unproductive.

>“Philosopher Blaise Pascal said, “All of humanity’s problems stem from [our] inability to sit quietly in a room alone.”” (Whillans, 2020, p. 25)

Trap 5 is idleness aversion.

>“Dan Gilbert, a professor of psychology at Harvard, placed some college students in an empty room and gave them nothing to do. Most students, accustomed to constant stimulation and easy access to distractors, did not like this one bit. Many preferred to give themselves mild electric shocks to being left alone with their thoughts” (Whillans, 2020, p. 25)

>“As Gilbert summarized, “Most people boiled over in rage at the idea of doing nothing.”” (Whillans, 2020, p. 26) 

Holy shit, this author is good at finding the right anecdotes, the ones that hurt.

>“You see what’s happening. I said yes over and over (and over), until Saturday morning, when I woke up and thought, Damn! What was I thinking? Actually, as a researcher, I know what I was thinking: Even though I’m too busy now, Saturday is a ways off, and I’ll have time to do these things.” (Whillans, 2020, p. 27)

>“Statistically, the best predictor of how busy we are going to be next week is how busy we are right now” (Whillans, 2020, p. 27)

>“To start increasing your time affluence, you need a baseline understanding of your time-use decisions.” (Whillans, 2020, p. 36) 

Step 1: know what your mindset is (time-focused or money focused).  
Step 2: log your time on a particularly hard or busy day.    
Step 3: find time.

>“Practice the right kind of leisure time” (Whillans, 2020, p. 39) 

How to find time:  
- Eliminate bad time spent on things we don't like, or transform it by adding a positive activity. 
- Augment good time, protect and deepen focus during it.  
- Eliminate time confetti during our leisure time.

>“If you commit to finding two minutes per day to say hi to a stranger or do something for someone else, you’ll have added twelve hours of prosocial time to your year.” (Whillans, 2020, p. 41)

>“You can find time largely for free. It costs no money to cancel one optional meeting a week and take a walk instead. But there is a more direct way to subtract negative, time-impoverishing experiences, and that’s to buy your way out. You can fund time.” (Whillans, 2020, p. 42)

>“If that’s you, ask for time as a gift. Get others to fund your time if they intended to spend money on you anyway. We tend not to give these kinds of gifts, but people perceive gifts given with the intention of saving time to be more thoughtful and appreciated than gifts that are given with the intention of saving money, especially because most of us hesitate to make time-saving purchases for ourselves.” (Whillans, 2020, p. 46) 

THIS IS PERFECT, I NEED TO SHARE THIS.

>“This time, though, he set a price range, looked at reviews for a few TVs in that range, and picked one. That’s it. The whole process took less than thirty minutes. “It was really hard for me at first to get out of that mindset that I have to get the best TV for the best price,” he said. “But in the end, say I paid an extra hundred dollars. So what? I got my whole weekend back. Probably fifteen hours at least, for major purchases. It has really changed how I think about shopping.”” (Whillans, 2020, p. 47) 

Ok, there's a slight improvement to be made here. What are the time/money/quality of life consequence of a bad purchase? For example, I need a new backpack. A bad backpack will have holes, break in a year, be bad on my back, which could say reduce my energy by 5 minutes a day or 1 day a year, and then I have to get a replacement. If I spend 4 hours finding a better backpack, then I've saved myself 20 hours over the backpack's lifetime, and more if it lasts longer. There's a lot of leverage there for an extra hour of research, but you've got to do a quick calculation to make sure.

>“Our obsession with money is deeply rooted in how we’ve evolved.3 Our early ancestors who were successful and thrived learned how to trade. Then they developed currency, a tool that facilitated efficient transactions and allowed humans to proliferate.4 We are hard wired to think about, worry over, and carefully track finances, because the success of humanity has depended on our ability to access and use goods and money.5 Some researchers have gone so far as to call money a drug, because its physical effects are similar to those produced by natural and chemical substances in our bloodstream” (Whillans, 2020, p. 70) 

Oof, this is not true and not necessary to her claim. Yeah, money is deeply rooted. But money came before barter, and trade was done almost ledgerlessly, ironically, saving time in close-knit, stable communities.

>“Slack time removes the stress of making sure we fulfill all of our plans and allows for spontaneity. This spontaneity matters, because overefficiency carries negative consequences: when we are overly efficient in conversations, we enjoy them less.21 And prioritizing efficiency makes us more likely to miss opportunities to connect with weak ties: people who are likely to bring us creative ideas and new opportunities.” (Whillans, 2020, p. 75) 

Event time, in the context of other things, is called rough scheduling or slack time, and it creates chances for spontaneity.

>“Our analysis found that noncash benefits such as social experiences and paid leave had a greater impact on job satisfaction than additional money. All else being equal, time-centric benefits such as parental leaves, flextime, and sick days contributed to job satisfaction more than receiving an additional $38,000 in annual salary for someone making $48,000 per year. Think about that: a collection of time-smart benefits contributed as much to job satisfaction as a 79 percent increase in pay. These results held even after controlling for income, age, gender, education, industry, firm size, employer type, and firm revenue.6” (Whillans, 2020, p. 102) 

Choose jobs partially based on how much time outside of work they provide!

>“By moving to the city, you pay the same money but lose two bedrooms, a backyard, and a garage. Yet you gain twenty-two days (more than five hundred hours) to use in ways other than commuting. Suppose you plan to live there for at least five years. When making your purchase decision, then, the calculation isn’t how many bedrooms you’re paying for at one place versus the other, but rather whether the extra two bedrooms, a backyard, and a garage are worth the 110 days of your life you’ll lose to commuting over the next five years. Would you give up, or pay, three months out of sixty—5 percent of your time—for two bedrooms, a backyard, and a garage?” (Whillans, 2020, p. 104) 

Choose where to live & work that give you more time.

>“don’t Use Time Excuses” (Whillans, 2020, p. 109) 

Scheduling: say no more, don't give time as the reason, and plan for variety.

>“How did it get so late so soon? It’s night before it’s afternoon. December is here before it’s June. My goodness how the time has flewn. How did it get so late so soon? —Dr. Seuss” (Whillans, 2020, p. 143)
