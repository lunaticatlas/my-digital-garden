Condition: A fantastic book summarizing old research about the perception of time and then suggesting implications of newer, more speculative research. Absolutely worthwhile to read in it's entirety.

>“Time comprises a net in which phenomena suddenly appear in a wholly different light. These phenomena include feelings, memories, happiness, language, scholastic and professional achievements, one’s sense of self, consciousness, stress,” ([Wittmann and Butler, 2016, p. xi](zotero://select/library/items/JDSH4QHT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H3X2KBIC?page=12&annotation=7VM8W4CS))

>“It is worthwhile to take a closer look at the dimension of time, for it is inseparably tied to our experience as a whole, to our self consciousness—to life itself. We are time.” ([Wittmann and Butler, 2016, p. xiii](zotero://select/library/items/JDSH4QHT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H3X2KBIC?page=14&annotation=THTHZLBS))

>“What precisely this means, the following pages seek to show.” ([Wittmann and Butler, 2016, p. xiii](zotero://select/library/items/JDSH4QHT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H3X2KBIC?page=14&annotation=9WF9TUGR))

>“temporal myopia. Only what is located within a certain horizon of presence proves relevant for the actions of the temporally myopic individual.” ([Wittmann and Butler, 2016, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/JDSH4QHT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H3X2KBIC?page=20&annotation=6FK8WTRP))

Being able to integrate larger time horizons is important for our decisions. Think of longtermism, timeless decision theory, delayed gratification. Myopia describes an extreme deficiency, but there is clearly an axis.
  
>==Where is the limit of my time horizon?==

>“Emotions and the experience of time change correspondingly; they are closely interlocked.” ([Wittmann and Butler, 2016, p. 20](zotero://select/library/items/JDSH4QHT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H3X2KBIC?page=35&annotation=589X5MUW))

>“Sten Nadolny’s novel, The Discovery of Slowness” ([Wittmann and Butler, 2016, p. 23](zotero://select/library/items/JDSH4QHT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H3X2KBIC?page=38&annotation=NU5D9ZZ6))

Source of a very interesting story about a person with a 'long exposure time,' for him moments are minutes instead of seconds:

>“Unlike the other sailors, he does not see the beam as a wandering circle of light, but as an extended curve in space. It occurs to him that he must inhabit a broader present than his fellow human beings; for him, several moments are always bundled together, into one. Today, we might use language borrowed from camera technology and say that Franklin has a long “exposure time.” His perception is slowed down so much that he experiences successive events as if they were simultaneous.” ([Wittmann and Butler, 2016, p. 24](zotero://select/library/items/JDSH4QHT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H3X2KBIC?page=39&annotation=BJ3MS5MD))

>“Comparing the temporal order thresholds for different senses reveals that in young people—typically students, the “customer base” for university research—the order of magnitude involves a few ten thousandths of a second (milliseconds, ms); more specifically, the range lies between 20 and 60 ms.1 Older people, on the other hand, have elevated order thresholds; this is because cognitive performance diminishes somewhat with age” ([Wittmann and Butler, 2016, p. 26](zotero://select/library/items/JDSH4QHT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H3X2KBIC?page=41&annotation=378G9HAC))

>“All that is processed within the period defined by such a state—at a duration of approximately 30 ms—is experienced as simultaneous.” ([Wittmann and Butler, 2016, p. 27](zotero://select/library/items/JDSH4QHT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H3X2KBIC?page=42&annotation=V4HCN6HM))

>“More likely, however—and this speaks against an overly simplistic view—several different processing mechanisms operate in parallel on different time scales in the subsecond range to generate the perception of succession of world events over time.” ([Wittmann and Butler, 2016, p. 29](zotero://select/library/items/JDSH4QHT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H3X2KBIC?page=44&annotation=ZSJJLA4Q))

>“The question of whether the brain has a rhythm that structures perception and motor operations has not yet been answered. If such a central clock existed and the brain’s rhythm became imbalanced (say, after an injury), then all the senses—hearing, seeing, and feeling—would have to be impaired, in addition to the slowing down of behavior. Indeed, there are clinical cases of patients who display such disturbances after a brain tumor or brain inflammation. They are rare, however.” ([Wittmann and Butler, 2016, p. 33](zotero://select/library/items/JDSH4QHT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H3X2KBIC?page=48&annotation=JXT65639))

>“A familiar saying holds that we live from one moment to the next—that we move from one instant to the following one, as it were. However, it might be more appropriate to say that our conscious experience is determined by a constant being-present through which events pass: from futurity, which is not yet fixed, to what is experienced in the moment, and then onward, into the past” ([Wittmann and Butler, 2016, p. 44](zotero://select/library/items/JDSH4QHT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H3X2KBIC?page=59&annotation=KRP6VRGV)) 

Holy shit, what a perspective flip! Are we moving through time, or is time moving through us? Are we sieves, not vessels?

>“The American philosopher Dan Lloyd offers the following example: anyone familiar with the Beatles will already expect “Jude” as soon as Paul McCartney’s voice intones “Hey” in the song “Hey Jude.” Even though the word has not yet been voiced, somehow it is already present. Likewise, when “Jude” is heard, the “Hey” remains present, even if vibrations in the air are no longer verifiable.10 The line “Hey Jude” is perceived as a whole.” ([Wittmann and Butler, 2016, p. 45](zotero://select/library/items/JDSH4QHT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H3X2KBIC?page=60&annotation=XSRMNS3S))

>“copresent” ([Wittmann and Butler, 2016, p. 46](zotero://select/library/items/JDSH4QHT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H3X2KBIC?page=61&annotation=26NCHKBU)) 
A beautiful term for events which occupy the same moment.

>“Analyses performed by Ernst Pöppel have determined that temporal units lasting approximately three seconds occur in music and poetry across cultures.” ([Wittmann and Butler, 2016, p. 46](zotero://select/library/items/JDSH4QHT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H3X2KBIC?page=61&annotation=A7288YCQ))

>“Our purposeful movements tend to have the same duration. Human communication takes place in a series of segments: the speaker bundles linguistic information into units, and the hearer registers them in the same way. Accordingly, verbal communication unfolds in a constant rhythm of three-second intervals. Because both partners in an exchange interact by means of these segments, that is, share a rhythm with each other—communication can be effortless.” ([Wittmann and Butler, 2016, p. 50](zotero://select/library/items/JDSH4QHT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H3X2KBIC?page=65&annotation=V3EMDUZQ))

>“In terms of underlying cognitive processes, working memory forms the temporal bridge between individual moments of lived experience and gives rise to the feeling that one’s own ego exists continuously in the world.” ([Wittmann and Butler, 2016, p. 51](zotero://select/library/items/JDSH4QHT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H3X2KBIC?page=66&annotation=7XAICMWW)) We have a 30ms simultaneity, 3 second (3000ms) moment, and a 30 second-5 minute working memory. These are all orders of magnitude!

>“Working memory constitutes a temporal horizon of mental presence within which the conscious experience of the narrative self is maintained over time, as a continuum. However, the narrative self is composed of stories we tell ourselves about ourselves; it draws from autobiographical long-term memory.” ([Wittmann and Butler, 2016, p. 52](zotero://select/library/items/JDSH4QHT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H3X2KBIC?page=67&annotation=S6D8HA6X))

>“It is understandable, then, that experiences seem less intense: our attention must be divided (or, more precisely, it shifts back and forth quickly) between tasks.” ([Wittmann and Butler, 2016, p. 55](zotero://select/library/items/JDSH4QHT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H3X2KBIC?page=70&annotation=F73VZW7D))

>“Where full attention is lacking, intensive experience is impossible. The Stanford literary theorist Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht expresses it as follows: what is missing is presence.” ([Wittmann and Butler, 2016, p. 56](zotero://select/library/items/JDSH4QHT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H3X2KBIC?page=71&annotation=T6H5C29U))

>“It is no accident that a period of a single relaxed breath lasts for about three seconds. The span of a breath lasts for the precise duration of a moment of lived experience.” ([Wittmann and Butler, 2016, p. 58](zotero://select/library/items/JDSH4QHT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H3X2KBIC?page=73&annotation=ZCQI7SC3))

>“Robert Levine, an American social psychologist, has summarized his findings impressively in his book A Geography of Time.” ([Wittmann and Butler, 2016, p. 62](zotero://select/library/items/JDSH4QHT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H3X2KBIC?page=77&annotation=FHQNQLRJ))

>“Levine’s analysis yields two fundamental cultures of time: the first works according to event-time, the second according to the abstract time of the clock. In the first case, people are oriented toward the duration of an event. A meeting can only take place when some prior activity (e.g., a conversation or a meal) has been completed. In contrast, people who are oriented toward the abstract time of the clock will interrupt what they are doing in order to keep an appointment.” ([Wittmann and Butler, 2016, p. 63](zotero://select/library/items/JDSH4QHT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H3X2KBIC?page=78&annotation=S89KDNGY)) 

This is the distinction I am hunting! I want a time-management app which corresponds to event time, not clock time. Instead of the trigger being some clock, it is my perception that an event has ended.

>“Such results match what is described in Morgenstern’s poem: if one is distracted, time seems shorter.” ([Wittmann and Butler, 2016, p. 68](zotero://select/library/items/JDSH4QHT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H3X2KBIC?page=83&annotation=44FRSDGQ)) 

Time is longer when we pay attention to it, when our attention is elewhere (distracted, or in flow) time is shorter.

>“Because society is calibrated to the chronotype of the early riser—school and work start between eight and nine o’clock, at the latest, and sometimes even earlier (e.g., hospitals and bakeries)—even a moderately late riser must live at odds with his or her inner clock. In this context, Till Roenneberg, a chronobiologist at the Institute for Medical Psychology at the University of Munich, speaks of “social jetlag.”23” ([Wittmann and Butler, 2016, p. 81](zotero://select/library/items/JDSH4QHT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H3X2KBIC?page=96&annotation=V8VDL3FY)) 

Here's an interesting design problem: can we create a society which allows for all chronotypes to wake and sleep at their desired hours?

>“Experiences that are exciting and new expand time. But when what was novel becomes a matter of routine, time starts to pass quickly again.” ([Wittmann and Butler, 2016, p. 87](zotero://select/library/items/JDSH4QHT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H3X2KBIC?page=102&annotation=MV48KFP7)) 

We have these factors which expand and contract our sense of time: attention, novelty versus distraction and routine. How do we use them to move towards our ideal sense of time?

>“A prospective judgment of time occurs when a person estimates the duration of an event while it is still happening. That is, she actively directs her attention to the course of time. We make retrospective judgments by assessing the length of time after the conclusion of an event—that is, by looking back at it. Wholly different cognitive processes are thought to occur in these two forms of temporal perception.” ([Wittmann and Butler, 2016, p. 88](zotero://select/library/items/JDSH4QHT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H3X2KBIC?page=103&annotation=3R2SI44D)) 

Here, again, is the split between the experiencing and remembering self.

>“Boredom, in this context, amounts to the feeling that time is passing slowly” ([Wittmann and Butler, 2016, p. 89](zotero://select/library/items/JDSH4QHT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H3X2KBIC?page=104&annotation=XBLNJH5K)) 

But boredom is the same thing as attention, in the absence of other engaging tasks, we pay attention to the time.

>“In general, we can say that events are stored because they are charged with a certain level of affect.8 Alternatively, the episodes in our lives that we remember depend on the feelings we associate with them. The greater the store of lived experience—that is, the more emotional coloration and variety one’s life has—the longer one’s lifetime seems, subjectively.” ([Wittmann and Butler, 2016, p. 90](zotero://select/library/items/JDSH4QHT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H3X2KBIC?page=105&annotation=3TFCZLEP)) 

To lengthen your lifespan, feel more deeply.

>“People with a shortened temporal perspectivewhich need not stem from sickness or imminent death, but can also result from leaving one’s home country (or just familiar surroundings)—change their social preferences; they seek out others to whom they feel emotionally close.” ([Wittmann and Butler, 2016, p. 92](zotero://select/library/items/JDSH4QHT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H3X2KBIC?page=107&annotation=D8HYZV9V)) 

We need things like socialization over a percieved period of time, when our perception shrinks, our needs become more immediate and pressing.

>“Death: Experts, Deniers—and Investigators” ([Wittmann and Butler, 2016, p. 94](zotero://select/library/items/JDSH4QHT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H3X2KBIC?page=109&annotation=WSFM27EI)) 

This is an interesting classification of the way people approach death: experts, who think they know what to expect, deniers, who don't worry or think about it, and investigators, who feel challenged by it and want answers.

>“In the language of memory psychology: Live in such a way that your life is varied and emotionally rich; then you will live for a long time.” ([Wittmann and Butler, 2016, p. 100](zotero://select/library/items/JDSH4QHT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H3X2KBIC?page=115&annotation=2XWM9GM2))

>“It is interesting, in this context, that many psychiatric maladies—such as drug addiction and anxiety disorders—can be described as disturbed homeostatic processes, as Martin Paulus at the University of California, San Diego, has postulated” ([Wittmann and Butler, 2016, p. 110](zotero://select/library/items/JDSH4QHT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H3X2KBIC?page=125&annotation=QL8BAVMZ)) 

I think this is an important idea: where our equilibrium lies can be disturbed, so that we drift to one homeostatic basin instead of another. This is important for time and feeling, but also for friendships, which display other equilibria (look into this in Gravity and Grace!).

>“This puzzle, known as the qualia problem in philosophy, holds that even if we completely understood how the brain functions, we still could not explain how the phenomenal contents of consciousness (qualia) come about. Even though phenomenal consciousness may always be correlated with certain processes in the brain, these neurophysiological events (which involve neural systems, transmitters, synapses, etc.) are something wholly different from my feelings. Many philosophers contend that this gap is unbridgeable in principle.” ([Wittmann and Butler, 2016, p. 112](zotero://select/library/items/JDSH4QHT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H3X2KBIC?page=127&annotation=RIFCQ97U))

>“As the degree of kinship between great apes and human beings decreases, so too does the number of VENs.” ([Wittmann and Butler, 2016, p. 113](zotero://select/library/items/JDSH4QHT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H3X2KBIC?page=128&annotation=S7MMUNQI)) 

Von economo neurons, located in a particular region of the brain (the same involving interoception) are present in those species which seem more conscious and less in species which are 'less conscious' by our current tests.

>“nature achieves wholly unpleasant self-awareness” ([Wittmann and Butler, 2016, p. 115](zotero://select/library/items/JDSH4QHT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H3X2KBIC?page=130&annotation=ARAUZTPK))

If they had minds, would the stones be bored?

>“In keeping with the philosophical reflections offered above, this means: no time, no self” ([Wittmann and Butler, 2016, p. 116](zotero://select/library/items/JDSH4QHT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H3X2KBIC?page=131&annotation=IZN7SPAW))

>“the time we’ve freed up is filled with even more activities and deadlines.” ([Wittmann and Butler, 2016, p. 116](zotero://select/library/items/JDSH4QHT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H3X2KBIC?page=131&annotation=V4ZIMWCG))

>“Chapter 3 discussed a possibility for acquiring mindfulness: living in the moment. Small changes in the attention we pay to what is happening to us offer the key to having a sense of control” ([Wittmann and Butler, 2016, p. 117](zotero://select/library/items/JDSH4QHT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H3X2KBIC?page=132&annotation=VEHXN5SQ))

>“time-management is, in essence, and contrary to suggestions of many books on time-management, making wise use of oneself and one’s feelings” ([Wittmann and Butler, 2016, p. 118](zotero://select/library/items/JDSH4QHT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H3X2KBIC?page=133&annotation=PMAIYPPC))

>“Via the feeling of emotional self-control, we can achieve a sense of “deceleration.”” ([Wittmann and Butler, 2016, p. 118](zotero://select/library/items/JDSH4QHT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H3X2KBIC?page=133&annotation=KVQS5HFX))

>“Even though the amount of work and demands on time tend to increase the higher the position held, physical and psychological stress reactions decrease the more one ascends professionally. This is because, at lower levels in the hierarchy, the work is more often imposed by others. It is easier for the boss to divide his time according to the motto of organizational psychology: “One thing at a time.” In contrast, a secretary, although still busy completing an earlier assignment, will often be given a new job to do right away.” ([Wittmann and Butler, 2016, p. 119](zotero://select/library/items/JDSH4QHT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H3X2KBIC?page=134&annotation=ELST9E49)) 

This is a very interesting idea: that stress reactions decrease as you ascend the managerial hierarchy, because of the new amounts of control you have over the work. This is the opposite of what a hedge-fund manager might have argued: that the responsibility, and risk, creates even more stress.

>“Proust’s In Search of Lost Time” ([Wittmann and Butler, 2016, p. 120](zotero://select/library/items/JDSH4QHT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H3X2KBIC?page=135&annotation=IFFQZ4JR))

>“Counter to what some researchers assume, there is no autonomous clock in the brain responsible exclusively for temporal perception. The feeling of time requires that signals arriving in the brain without interruption be collected. How long did the tone last? In accordance with a certain quantity of signals arriving from the body. Why was one stimulus longer than the other? Because more bodily signals were collected. It follows that temporal perception is based on the perception and integration of physical processes” ([Wittmann and Butler, 2016, p. 130](zotero://select/library/items/JDSH4QHT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H3X2KBIC?page=145&annotation=VJHJIXZ9))

>“She was all body. In this, she was very close to the passing of time.” ([Wittmann and Butler, 2016, p. 137](zotero://select/library/items/JDSH4QHT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H3X2KBIC?page=152&annotation=Y695WCCA)) 

We are time, because time is embodied: it is only known through our heartbeat, hunger, and other bodily signals and rhythms.
