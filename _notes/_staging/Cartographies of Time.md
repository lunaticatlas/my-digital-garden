>‚ÄúAnd, for all of the excellent work that has been recently published on the history and theory of cartography, we have few examples of critical work in the area of what Eviatar Zerubavel has called time maps.2 This book is an attempt to address that gap. In many ways, this work is a reflection on linesstraight and curved, branching and crossing, simple and embellished, technical and artistic‚Äîthe basic components of historical diagrams. Our claim is that the line is a much more complex and colorful figure than is usually thought.‚Äù (Rosenberg and Grafton, 2010, p. 10)

>‚ÄúBut simple and intuitive as they seem, these timelines are not without a history themselves. They were not always here to help us in our lectures, and they have not always taken the forms that we unthinkingly give them. They are such a familiar part of our mental furniture that it is sometimes hard to remember that we ever acquired them in the first place. But we did.‚Äù (Rosenberg and Grafton, 2010, p. 10)

>‚ÄúOur idea of time is so wrapped up with the metaphor of the line that taking them apart seems virtually impossible. According to the literary critic W. J. T. Mitchell, ‚ÄúThe fact is that spatial form is the perceptual basis of our notion of time, that we literally cannot ‚Äòtell time‚Äô without the mediation of space.‚Äù10 Mitchell argues that all temporal language is ‚Äúcontaminated‚Äù by spatial figures. ‚ÄúWe speak of ‚Äòlong‚Äô and ‚Äòshort‚Äô times, of ‚Äòintervals‚Äô (literally, ‚Äòspaces between‚Äô), of ‚Äòbefore‚Äô and ‚Äòafter‚Äô‚Äîall implicit metaphors which depend upon a mental picture of time as a linear continuum . . . . Continuity and sequentiality are spatial images based in the schema of the unbroken line or surface; the experience of simultaneity or discontinuity is simply based in different kinds of spatial images from those involved in continuous, sequential experiences of time.‚Äù11‚Äù (Rosenberg and Grafton, 2010, p. 13)

>‚ÄúPetrarch carefully indicated the present date in letters he addressed to the ancients Cicero and Virgil and to future readers to emphasize the length of the interval that separated him from them: ‚ÄúWritten in the land of the living; on the right bank of the Adige, in Verona, a city of Transpadane Italy; on the 16th of June, and in the year of that God whom you never knew the 1345th.‚Äù‚Äù (Rosenberg and Grafton, 2010, p. 16)

>‚ÄúThe Bellman himself they all praised to the skiesSuch a carriage, such ease and such grace! Such solemnity, too! One could see he was wise, The moment one looked in his face! He had bought a large map representing the sea, Without the least vestige of land: And the crew were much pleased when they found it to be A map they could all understand. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the good of Mercator‚Äôs North Poles and Equators, Tropics, Zones, and Meridian Lines?‚Äù So the Bellman would cry: and the crew would reply ‚ÄúThey are merely conventional signs! ‚ÄúOther maps are such shapes, with their islands and capes! But we‚Äôve got our brave Captain to thank‚Äù (So the crew would protest) ‚Äúthat he‚Äôs bought us the bestA perfect and absolute blank!‚Äù ‚ÄúOcean Chart‚Äù and excerpt from Lewis Carroll‚Äôs The Hunting of the Snark, London, 1876‚Äù (Rosenberg and Grafton, 2010, p. 206)

>‚ÄúBut, while this newest generation of timelines promises chronological abundance as we have never had it before, it is not clear that it promises an advance, exactly. From the beginning, the biggest challenge of the time chart was not to include more data, but to clarify a historical pictureto offer a form that was intuitive and mnemonic, and that functioned well as a tool of reference. Whether or not the web 2.0 versions of the timeline will be up to this task is still to be seen.‚Äù (Rosenberg and Grafton, 2010, p. 246)
