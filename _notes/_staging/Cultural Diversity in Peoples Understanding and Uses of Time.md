Condition: A paper that is cool and almost starts to get at what I think is important about time.

“The authors identify ten concepts that summarize how culture affects intercultural interactions that are part of international business dealings: 
1. Clock and event time: Do people follow set schedules or let the event take its natural course before moving to another event? 
2. Punctuality: How sensitive are people to deviations from appointed times? 
3. The relation between task and social time during the workday; 
4. Whether people do one activity at a time or do many at once; 
5. Efficiency vs. effectiveness; 
6. Fast and slow paces of life; 
7. How people deal with long periods of silence; 
8. People’s time orientation: past, present and the future; 
9. The symbolic meaning of time; 
10. Cultural differences in importance” (Brislin and Kim, 2003, p. 363) 

I have personal preferences:  
1. Event time is more psychologically rich.  
2. Deviations are important when they impede relationships and event time.  
3. Social time is important.
4. One activity at a time.
5. Effectiveness.
6. Fast pace, but variation is nice.  
7. Silence is rare and delightful and has purpose.  
8. present oriented provides more psychological richness.  
9.   ????
10. Leisure and work are both important needs, not a hierarchy but a balance.

“In collective cultures, work gets done through webs of relationships” (Brislin and Kim, 2003, p. 368)
