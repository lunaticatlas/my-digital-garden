Condition: my scattered thoughts about an incredible woman who wrote things which are working on me.

I read:

- [[Simone Weil- An Anthology]]
- [[Gravity and Grace]]
- [[The Subversive Simone Weil]]

She is a firecracker of a human being, and someone approaching sainthood. She is a philosopher and a christian anarchist. She diligently did good, always organizing, pushing for truth, resisting fascism & capitalism & colonialism, even in dire conditions. She had a habit of sharing the suffering of others-- denying herself food in solidarity. Her dream was to send nurses onto the frontlines of war, willing to die, and to treat soldiers on both sides. It was the realization of an ideal, that people will die for peace.

Her work holds ideas that I find powerful:

The idea of attention, as an open-ended seeking. Not a tension in the muscles, not willpower, just opening oneself to truth, which she saw as the radiant representation of reality. This idea gets extended into the idea of 'reading' the world as if one were translating a foreign text. We must pay attention to what is, and work from there.

Second, her idea of gravity and grace. Gravity is the sum of forces (and oppression is the sharpened edge of these forces). Often, forces feel like laws, because they are out of individual control. Forces lower us, refuse our humanity. Grace, instead, is keeping a void open and not letting force fill it. Allowing us to see others as human, ask open questions, choosing which limits we will deny (some forces, when tested, hold strong, while others can be changed). Grace is the choice to do what is good in denial of force.

Third, her devotion to what is human. To always see someone as human first, not for their role, and to recognize that we have obligation towards every human need. To stop talking about rights and start talking about needs (because recognizing a right to eat is so much weaker than recognizing hunger). To move away from pride for ones nation and towards compassion, which one can feel for all nations: otherwise, patriotism binds people together.
