*Condition: this is the first draft of how I intend to grow this garden.*

### 1. This is a workspace.
I intend to do thinking here, working outside, in the elements. The focus, then, is on what I create, but with space for the tools as well. I want to make good maps of the World.

### 2. This is a garden.
I am inspired by the collection of digital gardens. Each page is something to be watered, the paths are formed by walking. I will plant many seeds, and some will grow. Everything is in progress.

### 3. This is a record.
In some ways, this space will also provide documentation for my life. I will keep a log of how this place grows over time, so that I can better keep the past alive in me.
