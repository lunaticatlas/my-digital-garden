Condition: unedited annotations from a book by [[Simone Weil]]


> “We have to try to cure our faults by attention and not by will.” (Weil and Miles, 2005, p. 231)

I love this idea: that turning our attention to a need is the important step. Weil also writes that to understand the world well is to narrow your choice down to one: the moral, informed choice. By attending to a problem, the solution will appear, and no willpower will be wasted trying faulty solutions.

> “Attention, taken to its highest degree, is the same thing as prayer. It presupposes faith and love. Absolutely unmixed attention is prayer. If we turn our minds towards the good, it is impossible that little by little the whole soul will not be attracted thereto in spite of itself.” (Weil and Miles, 2005, p. 232)


> “'Above all, never allow oneself to dream of friendship .... Friend­ship is not be to sought, dreamed about, longed for, but exercised (it is a virtue).'” (Weil and Miles, 2005, p. 281)


> “I was sustained by the faith, which I acquired at the age of fourteen, that no true effort of attention is ever wasted, even though it may never have any visible result, either direct or indirect.” (Weil and Miles, 2005, p. 282)
