Condition: A biology heavy book that is still deeply interesting to untangle. Felt Time offers some perspective on the work, but this is a much more measured, technical, and detailed look.*

>‚ÄúTo my mind, the deep significance of ongoing metaboreceptive and vasoreceptive feedback for interoceptive integration in the insular cortex is that it enables the homeostatic motor system to sense the effects of its own actions in the living body at high resolution and in real time. The integration of interoceptive sensory and homeostatic motor activities effectively forms what I call the high-fidelity sensorium. I propose that the dense vasoreceptive cortical input enables this integration to generate homeostatic sentience‚Äîand the feeling of being alive.‚Äù (Craig, 2015, p. 282)

Here goes: our motor system (the insular cortex) recieives a lot of interoceptive (self-percieving) feedback. This means that it feels the effects of it's actions on itself deeply, directly, and immediately. This, he argues, enables sentience (we can feel and react to our actions, in a loop, which looks a little like metacognition & evaluation). It more clearly creates the feeling of being alive in a body.

>‚ÄúLet me emphasize here a point that is central to this homeostatic model of feelings‚Äîthe goal of interoceptive integration, by nature, is to optimize energy efficiency in the process of homeostasis, and the goal of the progressive integration in the insular cortex is to optimize energy efficiency in the control of homeostatic emotional behavior.‚Äù (Craig, 2015, p. 283)

I think this clicked when I highlighted it. What evolution pressured our brains to do was maintain homeostasis. Feelings in this book means sensory feelings, like touch, heat, pain, stomach sensors, heartbeats, etc. These exist to push us into homeostasis. The click is that the push it towards "efficient homeostasis-- the shortest feedback loop possible, which pushes the sensory feedback loops lower into our motor cortex insteaf of our frontal lobes.


>‚Äúindicated by the convergent evidence that I described in chapter 7, the AIC of humans is where the model expands and many remarkable characteristics materialize. Once the integration of ongoing current conditions in the body and brain is complete and storage registers are available, then the dimension of time can be incorporated in a cinemascopic structure indexed by an endogenous oscillation. This mechanism provides the ability to perceive patterns of behavioral and emotional events across time, instead of simply integrating the effects of one‚Äôs immediate behavior on current emotional conditions. Important interactions with one‚Äôs prior behaviors, as well as with the predictions of internal behavioral models that anticipate others‚Äô behaviors, are incorporated. In addition, the comparator buffers necessary to make such comparisons of feelings across time provide the window for subjective awareness to emerge.‚Äù (Craig, 2015, p. 283)

Once we have access to short-term memory (aka storage registers are available), suddenly we can register short rhythmic feedback loops, like breath, heartbeat, etc., even if they are aperiodic (aka endogenous oscillations). Suddenly, we are aware of how long past and future actions take in proportion to other bodily rhythms (aka a subjectiv awareness emerges).


>‚ÄúA key aspect of the idea of homeostatic sentience is that it takes its perspective from the motor side, rather than the feeling side, of the action-perception cycle. It is the motor system, rather than the sensory system, which becomes sentient, if you will.‚Äù (Craig, 2015, p. 285)

This is cool, to me, because it throws a wrench in consciousness coming from our reflective side. Here is a much smaller, consciousness-like characteristic that all sorts of animals are likely to share. Instead, consciousness comes from being active in the world. Some would call this 'being agent-y', instead of passive.


>‚ÄúFrom the perspective of the preautonomic homeostatic motor system, having this high-fidelity interoceptive sensory capacity means that for every motor output signal, there is a sensory signal that provides precise, biologically information-rich feedback on the effect of that output in the living tissue. Essentially, that motor output command can sense what it‚Äôs doing‚Äîcan ‚Äúfeel‚Äù its own actions‚Äîand so it is the motor output system, the agent, that becomes sentient and which now represents a living being, rather than merely a motile organism.‚Äù (Craig, 2015, p. 286)

This was tough for me to take in at once. I think the implications and the wrench this throws into old worldviews is important. I can't summarize what this shook up for me. 

This deserves more rumination, so here are some fragments to consider: *"from the perspective of," "high fidelity," "the effect... in the living tissue," "the agent," "a living being," "a motile organism*. **This is the point of reading this book.**
