Condition: [A Ted Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUrrljujWc0) that's a pretty quick overview of two perspectives of time and the tradeoffs.*

My notes after watching:
We know that clock timers are better at freely rearranging their time, but they are not correlated or causally related, and the control if given to the external clock.

For event timers, events are interdependent and given internal control. Event timers overestimate the causal relations between unrelated events, while clock timers see the world as more random and chaotic. 

Event timers are more likely to immerse themselves in moments, display their emotions more, and share their emotions more later. Clock timers are less likely to seize opportunities that require rearranging their schedule (exploding opportunities). Clock-time can impair performance on non-standardized tasks.

We need an economic system which uses clocks when they are useful, not all the time.
