>““There exists an obligation towards every human being for the sole reason that he or she is a human being, without any other condition requiring to be fulfilled, and even without any recognition of such obligation on the part of the individual concerned.”” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 8)

We owe each other, only because human, whether anyone sees it or not.

>“Weil was exceptional in her refusal to be “deflected” from the reality of life. And yet this inability to be deflected is a gift, or curse, that most of us would gladly refuse. This is how it is—perhaps even as it should be.” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 10)

>““If one stops oneself from thinking of all this, one makes oneself an accomplice of what is happening. One has to do something quite different: assume one’s place in this system of things and do something about it.”” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 14)

>“Yet just as a new book on skepticism risks reinventing the arguments made by Hume—and doing so less compellingly—so too with a book on attention that ignores Weil. Few thinkers have attended to the subject of attention as long and lucidly as this French thinker, and even fewer have made a more persuasive and paradoxical case for doing nothing as the most effective means for doing something lasting and important.” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 18)

>““Not only should man know what he is making, but, if possible, he should see how it is used—see how nature is changed by him. Every man’s work should be an object of contemplation for him.”” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 19)

>““Do you realize there are millions and millions of people on earth who suffer nearly always, from birth to death? It is a pity they have not learned expression; they would say the truth about suffering.”” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 27)

>“Weil announces that the Iliad’s true hero is not a warrior —not Hector or Patroclus or even Achilles—but force itself, as constant in the movement of human events as gravity is in the movement of physical objects. It is force that “enslaves man,” it is force “before which man’s flesh shrinks away,” and it is force that “modifies the human spirit.”” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 28)

>“These changes on the city’s surface reflected the ineluctability and inhumanity of force. This phenomenon, Weil argues, “turns anybody who is subjected to it into a thing. Exercised to the limit, it turns man into a thing in the most literal sense: it makes a corpse out of him.”” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 29)

>““Force is as pitiless to the man who possesses it, or thinks he does, as it is to its victims; the second it crushes, the first it intoxicates. The truth is, nobody really possesses it.”44 This is a truth that had already been pounded into Weil at Alsthom—namely, that power runs through the entirety of human affairs, but is controlled by no human, and that it “contains a sort of fatality which weighs as pitilessly on those who command as on those who obey.”” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 30)

>“As for those apologists who insisted that Stalinism was a perversion of Marxism, Weil was merciless. “Descartes used to say that a clock out of order is not an exception to the laws governing clocks, but a different mechanism obeying its own laws. This is how we should regard Stalin’s regime: not as a worker’s state out of order, but as a different social mechanism. Its definition is found in the wheels that compose it and which functions according to the nature of those wheels.”” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 31)

>“Weil makes clear she was aware of this problem. “Our personality,” she wrote, “seems to us a sort of limit . . . but it also appears to us a support, and we wish to believe there are things we would never be capable of doing or saying or thinking because it is not in our character.” This, she closes laconically, “often proves false.”” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 35)

This strikes me. we'd like to believe ourselves incapable of unaligned acts, or perhaps make ourselves incapable. But our environments drive us, so our conscious needs stronger barriers.

>“Refuse to be an accomplice. Don’t lie—don’t keep your eyes shut.” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 36)

>“The world is flush with such meanings—meanings that, in turn, fix our beliefs and acts. They sweep over us with such force, Weil writes (in English), that “my soul is no longer my own.”5 The risk of losing our souls as we read the world is especially great at times of crisis.” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 37)

Weil uses the metaphor of ‘reading’ the world, as if it is a language of signs we can learn to interpret.

>“In short, the way in which we read the world turns on our particular location-moral, social, political, and economic—within the world. And the world, of course, is what humankind makes of it.” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 38)

This is fairly materialist: what strikes us as true in our reading of the world is defined by what we are near.

>“Is there a center, as Weil asks in her notebooks, “from which may be seen the different possible readings—and their relationship—and our own only as one among them”? By way of a rather cryptic reply, she then suggests that we “transport ourselves to that center of thought from which the other person reads values; contemplate the values destroyed by what we are going to do.”9 While Weil is uncertain, at least at this point, about the precise location of the center, her means of transportation is what she calls “attention.”” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 38)

>“Weil would have taken issue with the claim that attention requires the mind’s concentration—tensing, really—on a specific issue. For Weil, this kind of mental tautness is, in fact, inimical to true attention. In Weil’s role as a teacher, we catch glimpses of what she understood by attention. For example, Anne Reynaud, one of her students at Roanne in 1933, recalled that Weil would take the class outdoors and gather them under a tall cedar tree where they would together “seek problems in geometry.”11 The phrase is telling: rather than “finding the answer,”” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 39)

Weil distinguishes attention from focus.

>“For Weil, attention is a “negative effort,” one that requires that we stand still rather than lean in. The object of this kind of attention could be mathematical or textual, a matter of grasping a puzzle posed by Euclid or one posed by Racine. Whether we do solve the problem, argues Weil, is secondary.” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 40)

>“Weil declares, leaves us “detached, empty, and ready to be penetrated by the object.”17 To attend means not to seek, but to wait; not to concentrate, but instead to dilate our minds.” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 40)

>““In every school exercise there is a special way of waiting upon truth, setting our hearts upon it, yet not allowing ourselves to go out in search of it . . . There is a way of waiting, when we are writing, for the right word to come of itself at the end of our pen, while we merely reject all inadequate words.”” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 41)

>“the capacity to give one’s attention to a sufferer is a very rare and difficult thing; it is almost a miracle; it is a miracle. Nearly all those who think they have this capacity do not possess it.”19 I, for one, know I do not possess it, not only because it collides with the way I think about thought, but also because it collides with the fact that I can rarely, if ever, think about anything or anyone else without also thinking about myself. To attend to a fellow human being entails far more than thinking about or even feeling for that person. Pity, like cognition, involves reaching toward another by acknowledging her suffering. In this respect, my faculty of sympathy fixes on someone else just as my faculty of thought does. And once it does, it most often compartmentalizes and forgets that person. As Weil notes, pity is unlike compassion in that “it consists in helping someone in misfortune so as not to be obliged to think about him anymore, or for the pleasure of feeling the distance between him and oneself.”20” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 41)

>“We do not fully understand a hammer, Martin Heidegger observed, simply by staring at it. Instead, understanding comes when we pick it up and use it. Weil gives this observation an unusual wrinkle: we do not fully understand a fellow human being by staring, thinking, or even commiserating with her. Instead, understanding comes only when we let go of our self and allow the other to grab our full attention. In order for the reality of the other’s self to fully invest us, we must first divest ourselves of our own selves.” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 41)

>“In a beautifully evocative phrase, Weil writes that when we translate a text from a foreign language into our own, we rightly do not seek to add anything to it. Ideally, this is how the student must approach the world. She must see and write about it as if she is translating “a text that is not written down.”” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 42)

>““every blow of fate, every pain, whether small or great, say to oneself: ‘I am being worked on.’”” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 44)

>“Weil even cites Marcus Aurelius: “The man who thinks he is ruled by a capricious nature is a slave, and the man who knows he is ruled by a nature determined by rigorous laws is a citizen of the world.”” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 44)

>“Instead, as Weil declares, attention is “the rarest and purest form of generosity.” The act of giving oneself—turning away from one’s own self and turning toward the world, making a place for others by placing one’s own self in a subordinate position—is true attention.” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 46)

>“Weil warns against seeing our fellow human beings as anything other than human beings. “I see a passerby in the street,” she writes, who “has long arms, blue eyes, and a mind whose thoughts I do not know, but perhaps they are commonplace.”” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 48)

>“It is this man; no more and no less . . . which is sacred to me”39 —and, at the same time, recall the warning from “The Love of God and Affliction” that we “can only accept the existence of affliction by considering it at a distance.”” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 48)

>“Even if defeat is inevitable, I will always choose to side with the vanquished workers than the victorious oppressors.” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 50)

>“I rebel—therefore we exist. Albert Camus” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 50)

>““If one stops oneself from thinking of all this, one makes oneself an accomplice of what is happening. One has to do something quite different: take one’s place in this system of things and do something about it.”” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 53)

>““if he had accepted to drink the water, he would have set himself apart from his soldiers . . . Sacrifice is the acceptance of pain, the refusal to obey one’s animal needs and the will to redeem the suffering of others by choosing to suffer as well.”” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 55)

>““collectivity” tends to shift from one text to the next, as does the word itself; at times, Weil applies the label of “blind social mechanism.” But the fundamental conception remains constant, pointing to the convergence of the political, social, cultural, and economic forces that dictate our lives.” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 59)

>“No matter how humane the intentions of an organization, no matter whether society is ordered on capitalist or socialist lines, oppression will not disappear. Oppression is nothing less than the sharp edge of force, and force is a natural, not social phenomenon. No less important, since force is inherently mercurial, always threatening to slip from the hands of oppressor to oppressed, “there is never power, but only a race for power.”” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 60)

>“Weil held this conviction to the end of her life, writing in her last work, The Need for Roots, that the phrase “love of truth” is misleading since truth is not an object. “A truth is always a truth with reference to something. Truth is the radiant manifestation of reality.”” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 64)

>“The good man is “the man who has the fewest lapses of attention.”” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 74)

>“Weil’s own insistence on the ethics of getting words right: “To clarify thought, to discredit intrinsically meaningless words, and to define the use of others by precise analysis—to do this, strange though it may appear, might be a way of saving human lives.”” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 74)

>““In defining one’s native country as a certain particular vital medium, one avoids the contradictions and lies which corrode the idea of patriotism . . . It has been produced by a network of causes in which good and evil, justice and injustice have been mixed up together, and so it cannot be the best possible one. It may have arisen at the expense of some other combination richer in vital properties, and if such has been the case, it would be right to regret the fact; but past events are over and done with; the particular medium happens to be in existence, and, such as it is, deserves to be guarded like a treasure for the good it contains.”” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 85)

>““By depriving peoples of their tradition, of their past, and thus of their soul, colonization reduces them to the state of matter, but matter that is human. The populations of occupied countries are just this in the eyes of the Germans. But it cannot be denied that the majority of the colonials have the same attitude toward the natives.”” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 86)

>“Weil writes that duty toward one’s country “does not require that we should give everything always, but that we should give everything sometimes,” she is making place for both compassion and force. Anticipating, perhaps influencing, Albert Camus’s distinction between rebellion and revolution, Weil argues for a form of resistance that encompasses both the effort to repel the Germans as occupiers and the effort to recall Germans as fellow human beings.” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 91)

>“Unlike pride in one’s nation, which is incapable of export to other nations, compassion for one’s own nation is, by its very nature, a universal impulse. To cultivate this sentiment is not only laudable, but also practical because it tightens the bonds of fraternity both between peoples and within a single people. For this reason, Weil insists, we must portray our country not only as beautiful and precious, but also as “imperfect [and] very frail.”” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 91)

>“For the philosopher Martha Nussbaum, Aristotle’s notion of dunamis, “human capability,” maps largely onto the current work of capability theorists. She writes that, for Aristotle, any “decent political plan would seek to promote a range of diverse and incommensurable goods, involving the unfolding and development of distinct human abilities. Moreover, it must seek to promote them not just for some overall aggregate but for each and every citizen.”” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 95)

>“Weil observes that the needs of the body—which include protection against violence, as well as housing, clothing, heating, hygiene, and medical attention—precede those of the soul.” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 95)

>“Weil declares that the past is a vital source of meaning and purpose. The teaching of history, however, is not as a mere “summary of dates and landmarks.” Instead, the past must be taught as tragedy portrayed it to the Greeks—as a visceral apprehension of truths that run deeper and darker than mere events. “Facts must not only be correct . . . but must be shown in their true perspective relatively to good and evil.” The historian must not just present the past as it really was (“A tissue of base and cruel acts in the midst of which a few drops of purity sparkle at long intervals”), but seek out the “indirect testimony” for those “drops of purity.”” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 97)

>““Just as there are certain culture-beds for certain microscopic animals, certain types of soil for certain plants,” Weil suggests, “so there is a certain part of the soul in everyone and certain ways of thought and action communicated from one person to another which can only exist in a national setting, and disappear when a country is destroyed.”” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 98)

>“Weil asserts: “Duty towards the human being as such—that alone is eternal.”” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 99)

>“In her essay “Human Personality,” Weil presents an unexpected illustration of her point. If someone tries to force a farmer to sell his eggs at a lower price, the farmer will reply: “I’ve the right to keep my eggs if you refuse to pay the asking price.” But now imagine a young girl who is forced into prostitution. “She will not talk about her rights,” Weil observes. “In such a situation, the word would sound ludicrously inadequate.”” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 100)

>“To frame sex trafficking as a violation of a human right, Weil believes, and not a violation of a human need is to miss the enormity of the act. For Weil, rights are the reflection of the modern, commercial, and contractual societies in which they were conceived. As a result, to describe what is done to this young girl as a violation of her rights is to obscure rather than clarify what is at stake—which is to say, her personhood.” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 100)

>“This goes to the heart of Weil’s enterprise: the corollary to another’s needs is our obligation to recognize them, regardless of conditions.” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 100)

>“Weil warned that a renewed emphasis on universal rights was inadequate to the challenge at hand.” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 101)

>“Until the twentieth century, observes the historian Samuel Moyn, the question of obligation and duty held center stage in juridical and philosophical debates, while rights were very much a sideshow. Now that these roles are reversed, he writes, the consequences are significant. “Human rights themselves wither when their advocates fail to cross the border into the language of duty; insofar as compliance with norms on paper is sought, the bearers of duties have to be identified and compelled to assume their burden.”” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 102)

>“The imperative of obligations and duties, Weil insisted, must be anchored in a place that will always hold fast. Such a place will be found not by digging deep, but instead by clambering high.” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 102)

>“Discerning the Good—the way the world truly is-- whittles down our range of choices to just one. As she explains, “I can only choose within the world that I can see, in the moral sense of ‘see’ which implies that clear vision is a result of moral imagination and moral effort.”30 For both Murdoch and Weil, to see clearly is to act coherently. What appear as two distinct activities are, in effect, one.” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 113)

>“Weil observed, the nurses would be laboring in combat conditions, under fire just like the soldiers. As a result, they could do little more than apply “dressings, tourniquets, and perhaps injections.”42 In the hope that she would lead the first group of volunteers, Weil herself took a first-aid course in London. But such activities were fundamentally beside the point. Almost immediately, Weil pivots to the plan’s real purpose. The women who volunteered for assignment would do so not to save the lives of wounded soldiers, but instead to offer up their own lives. They were prepared, of course, to bandage wounds. More important, though, they were prepared, even willing, to bleed and die themselves. Weil matter-of-factly notes that these “women would need to have a good deal of courage. They would need to offer their lives as a sacrifice . . . ready to be always at the most dangerous places and to face as much if not more danger than the soldiers who are facing the most.”” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 117)

>““There could be no better symbol of our inspiration than the corps of women suggested here. The mere persistence of a few humane services in the very center of the battle, the climax of inhumanity, would be a signal defiance of the inhumanity which the enemy has chosen for himself and which he compels us also to practice . . . A small group of women exerting day after day a courage of this kind would be a spectacle so new, so significant, and charged with such obvious meaning, that it would strike the imagination more than any of Hitler’s conceptions have done.” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 118)

>“Ideas come and settle in my mind by mistake, then, realizing their mistake, they absolutely insist on coming out. I do not know where they come from, or what they are worth, but, whatever the risk, I do not think I have the right to prevent this operation. Simone Weil” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 120)

>“Simone Pétrement makes a poignant confession in her biography of her friend: “Who would not be ashamed of oneself in Simone’s presence, seeing the life she led?”3 This has often been my experience with Weil. Reading her is always a revelation and a reproach. I have never met, and will never meet, the expectations she had of herself and others. But, to be honest, I have also felt at times the irritation and impatience that many who met her also felt, exasperated by her extreme character, confused not just by some of her philosophical ideals, but also by her insistence upon enacting them in our lives. “What I cannot stand,” she told her students, “is compromise.”” (Zaretsky, 2021, p. 121)
