>“All the natural movements of the soul are controlled by laws analogous to those of physical gravity. Grace is the only exception.” (Weil, 2002, p. 1) 
>

Here are the main ideas: gravity are the laws that souls follow (like natural laws), while grace is the supernatural.

> “light and gravity” (Weil, 2002, p. 1) 

Is light connected to grace? Or is it a natural force, like gravity?

>“Generally what we expect of others depends on the effect of gravity upon ourselves, what we receive from them depends on the effect of gravity upon them. Sometimes (by chance) the two coincide, often they do not. What is the reason that as soon as one human being shows he needs another (no matter whether his need be slight or great) the latter draws back from him? Gravity.” (Weil, 2002, p. 1)

In this argument, need naturally pushes people away from each other.

>“Base motives have in them more energy than noble ones. Problem: in what way can the energy belonging to the base motives be transferred to the noble ones?” (Weil, 2002, p. 2)

>“Analogous desires—very frequent in human beings. When in this state, I have several times succumbed to the temptation at least to say words which cause pain. Obedience to the force of gravity.” (Weil, 2002, p. 3)

Analogous desires: desires to level or make others equal with us is, acting on these is obedience to gravity.

>“The source of man’s moral energy is outside him, like that of his physical energy (food, air etc.). He generally finds it, and that is why he has the illusion—as on the physical plane—that his being carries the principle of its preservation within itself. Privation alone makes him feel his need. And, in the event of privation, he cannot help turning to anything whatever which is edible.” (Weil, 2002, p. 3) 

This is strong: all our energy for needs and for morals exist outside us-- but what are the sources? How can we turn external energies into moral action?

>“a chlorophyll conferring the faculty of feeding on light. Not to judge. All faults are the same. There is only one fault: incapacity to feed upon light, for where capacity to do this has been lost all faults are possible.” (Weil, 2002, p. 3)

This is a practice of forgiveness: all faults are an incapacity to feed on light, all mistakes are contextualized not by the virtue of the person but by their situation/environment and the energy it provides them.

>“Grace is the law of the descending movement. To lower oneself is to rise in the domain of moral gravity. Moral gravity makes us fall towards the heights.” (Weil, 2002, p.4)

This is tough to understand. To lower oneself (to not make sense) is to rise in the domain of moral gravity, which lifts us. **So the motion of grace starts with descent, not ascension.**

>“What does charity do in order to descend lower? Have those who have fallen so low pity on themselves?” (Weil, 2002, p. 4) 

I love a writer to opens questions instead of attempting to answer all.

>“Human mechanics. Whoever suffers tries to communicate his suffering (either by ill-treating someone or calling forth their pity) in order to reduce it” (Weil, 2002, p. 5) 

Those who break this law will be poisoned by their stagnant suffering. This melds with 'blocks' and emotional flows.

>“How gain deliverance from a force which is like gravity?” (Weil, 2002, p. 5) 

Such a genuine dream, to fly, to break the rules of gravity!

>“It is impossible to forgive whoever has done us harm if that harm has lowered us. We have to think that it has not lowered us, but has revealed our true level.” (Weil, 2002, p. 6) 

Harm does not necessarily lower us-- we can bear some suffering. But when hurt more than we could bear, so that we ask for help or react badly, we have revealed our true level or capacity (and thus are not compelled to resent the person who showed us).

>"That is a factor making for social stability.” (Weil, 2002, p. 6) 

The leveling of peers, so that all suffer equally. Stability here refers to a terrible hierarchy, while periods of unrest are periods of imagination and opportunity and contain elements of grace.

>“The search for equilibrium is bad because it is imaginary. Revenge. Even if in fact we kill or torture our enemy it is, in a sense, imaginary.” (Weil, 2002, p. 7) 

In what ways are we equal-- the relation always has borders, is limited to an incident or quality, which makes the attempted equilibrium false.

>“Every kind of reward constitutes a degradation of energy.” (Weil, 2002, p. 8) 

People acting on incentives reduce themselves

>“Hence imaginary advantages alone supply the energy for unlimited effort.” (Weil, 2002, p. 9) 

We should not become self-satisfied with good acts, for that undoes the good-- but instead, give ourselves temporary imaginary rewards (the smile of the king, of god) for the act. In this way, any virtue is only rewarded as it is practiced, it is never absorbed as an identity.

> “I also am other than what I imagine myself to be. To know this is forgiveness.” (Weil, 2002, p. 9)

>“Not to exercise all the power at one’s disposal is to endure the void. This is contrary to all the laws of nature. Grace alone can do it.” (Weil, 2002, p. 10) 

To practice restraint, to leave space for others, to not exhaust all the possibilities and energy for our aims: this creates the "void." to surrender some of our agenty-ness to an other.

>“Grace fills empty spaces but it can only enter where there is a void to receive it, and it is grace itself which makes this void.” (Weil, 2002, p. 10)

>“Yet first there must be a tearing out, something desperate has to take place, the void must be created. Void: the dark night.” (Weil, 2002, p. 11) 

We make a void by denying admiration and by forgiving debts of harm suffered or kindness given. But this void is desperate, 'there is a tearing out.'

>“Man only escapes from the laws of this world in lightning flashes. Instants when everything stands still, instants of contemplation, of pure intuition, of mental void, of acceptance of the moral void. It is through such instants that he is capable of the supernatural.” (Weil, 2002, p. 11)

>“But we must not throw ourselves into it.” (Weil, 2002, p. 11) 

We should create the void, but then not fill it or throw ourselves into it. We only endure moments with it, and let Grace fill it.

>“To forgive debts. To accept the past without asking for future compensation. To stop time at the present instant. This is also the acceptance of death.” (Weil, 2002, p. 12) 

To expect the past without asking for a particular future!

>“To detach our desire from all good things and to wait. Experience proves that this waiting is satisfied. It is then we touch the absolute good.” (Weil, 2002, p. 13)

>“For the good which we can neither picture nor define is a void for us. But this void is fuller than all fullnesses.” (Weil, 2002, p. 13)

>“Love is not consolation, it is light.” (Weil, 2002, p. 14)

So be it. So it goes.

>“Attachment is no more nor less than an insufficiency in our sense of reality. We are attached to the possession of a thing because we think that if we cease to possess it, it will cease to exist.” (Weil, 2002, p. 14)

This makes me cry. To love things for their existence, not for any thread between them. To know that good is not made sense of through our threads of connection, but exists, somehow, outside of all of them.

>“A great many people do not feel with their whole soul that there is all the difference in the world between the destruction of a town and their own irremediable exile from that town.” (Weil, 2002, p. 14)

>“Human misery would be intolerable if it were not diluted in time. We have to prevent it from being diluted in order that it should be intolerable.” (Weil, 2002, p. 14)
>

To debase oneself (I am curious about that etymology)!

>“All suffering which does not detach us is wasted suffering.” (Weil, 2002, p. 15)

>“We must experience the fact that we love him, even if he does not exist.” (Weil, 2002, p. 15)

>“The imagination, filler up of the void, is essentially a liar. It does away with the third dimension, for only real objects have three dimensions. It does away with multiple relationships.” (Weil, 2002, p. 17) 

To have multiple relationships with a thing (a many to many connection). This feels important.

>“If we accept no matter what void, what stroke of fate can prevent us from loving the universe? We have the assurance that, come what may, the universe is full.” (Weil, 2002, p. 18) 

This is deeply beautiful, and this idea can help me understand the removal of desires: the universe is full.

>“Past and future, man’s only riches.” (Weil, 2002, p. 19)

>“Hunger: we imagine kinds of food, but the hunger itself is real: we have to fasten on to the hunger.” (Weil, 2002, p. 23)

>“Far from thinking with all the intensity of which we are capable of the values to which we are attached, we must preserve an interior void.” (Weil, 2002, p. 25)

>“Everything without exception which is of value in me comes from somewhere other than myself, not as a gift but as a loan which must be ceaselessly renewed.” (Weil, 2002, p. 31)

Not vessels, but sieves.

>“Everything which is grasped by our natural faculties is hypothetical. It is only supernatural love that establishes anything. Thus we are co-creators. We participate in the creation of the world by decreating ourselves.” (Weil, 2002, p. 33)
